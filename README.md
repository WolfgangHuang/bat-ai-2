Bias Aversion Toolset for Application Info

This repo contains contains various files to establish a process wherein unconscious bias in applicant information can be identified.

Contains

0: name replacement (keep socio-characteristics)

1: assuming a certain data storage structure, move and rename files for further processing

2: pdf conversion to text

2: masking/PII removal

3: vectorisation

3: ml-based class prediction with random forest, LogisticRegression and XGBoost

The code assumes a certain data structure, so it will not be easily usable for just any other data. If you wish to adopt it for your purposes, feel free to contact me.
The repo does not contain the data (only code). PII removal is part of the process, so I cannot share the unmasked data.
